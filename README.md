# Ola Ride Sales Analysis

## Overview
Exploratory data analysis on ride-level data to understand demand patterns,
revenue behavior, and peak-hour inefficiencies.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL
- Power BI

## Key Analysis
- Analyzed ride demand variation across different hours and days to identify peak and off-peak periods.
- Studied revenue distribution to understand high-value rides and booking patterns.
- Identified peak-hour inefficiencies affecting ride availability and pricing.
- Observed customer booking behavior to highlight repeat usage patterns.


## Outcome
Derived actionable insights to support pricing optimization,
better driver allocation during peak hours,
and improved operational efficiency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on ride booking data to understand demand patterns, cancellations, customer behavior, and operational inefficiencies.
